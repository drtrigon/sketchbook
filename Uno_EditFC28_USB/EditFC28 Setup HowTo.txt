--- Needs the USB interface of Arduino UNO ---

1. Reset UNO; bridge GND - RESET pin => NO SKETCH/CODE FOR ARDUINO NEEDED

2. Connect to FC-28; Uno GND - FC28 Trainer SHIELD

3. Connect to FC-28; Uno pin 0 (RX) - FC28 Trainer pin 3
   (from USB/serial PC to  FC-28)

4. Connect to FC-28; Uno pin 1 (TX) - FC28 Trainer pin 2
   (from FC-28 to USB/serial PC)

5. Bridge FC28 Trainer pin 4 - 5 (switches Transmitter ON)

When using the PCB/shield given in the fritzing file/PDF use a 1:1 cable
with shield=pin7.


--- Needs USB driver software ---

A.1. Install Arduino IDE to Win 7; https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software - download the installer file

-or-

B.1. Install Arduino USB Driver only; https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software - download the ZIP file and 
     decompress it, you will find a driver folder in it
     (you might have to copy the driver folder from network share to desktop first)

  2. Connect Arduino and watch how the driver install will fail

  3.1. Open the Windows Device Manager (right-click to Computer) and right click onto "Arduino Uno"

  3.2. Choose "Update driver software...", select to search the computer for files and open
       the driver folder decompressed before


--- Needs EditFC28 software ---

1. Run Installer as Admin; http://www.christian-karbacher.de/editfc28download.htm


--- Connect Arduino ---

1. Connect to PC and pass-through to VirtualBox Win 7 Guest (Geräte >> USB Geräte > >> Arduino ...) and wait for driver to install

2. Check COM port number (e.g. COM3) from Windows Device Manager

3. Run/Open EditFC28 as Admin

4. Config under Optionen >> Schnittstelle

5. Get Data with Empfangen (FC28->PC)
