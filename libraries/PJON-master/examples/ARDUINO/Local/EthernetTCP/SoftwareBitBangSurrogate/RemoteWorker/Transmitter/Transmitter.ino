/* This sketch is a modified copy of the example:
   ARDUINO/Local/EthernetTCP/PingPong/Transmitter.

   In this context it is a "RemoteWorker" for a corresponding "Surrogate" on a
   SoftwareBitBang bus, connected to the Surrogate via Ethernet TCP.
   The surrogate will connect to this device, allowing this device to talk to
   all devices on the SWBB bus by their ids, and receiving all packets sent to
   the id if this device on the SWBB bus.

   It sends BLINK to device id 44 which is on a SWBB bus connected to the
   Surrogate, and receives BLINK replies back.
   Device 44 is the example:
   ARDUINO/Local/SoftwareBitBang/BlinkWithResponse/Receiver.

   This is just a demonstration of the concept. It is more meaningful when the
   RemoteWorker is not an Arduino but a process on a PC or a RPI, effectively
   allowing that process to transparently be part of a SWBB bus. The Surrogate
   will "phone home" to the RemoteWorker to create a permanent link.
   The two alternative modes differ in the speed and the number of sockets used.
   ETCP_SINGLE_DIRECTION is fastest and recommended if not on limited hardware.

   Ethernet strategies and related concepts are contributed by Fred Larsen. */
