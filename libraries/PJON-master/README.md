## PJON v11.0
PJON® (Padded Jittering Operative Network) is an Arduino compatible, multi-master, multi-media network protocol. It proposes a Standard, it is designed as a framework and implements a totally software emulated network protocol stack that can be easily cross-compiled on many architectures like ATtiny, ATmega, ESP8266, ESP32, STM32, Teensy, Raspberry Pi, Linux and Windows x86 machines. It is a valid tool to quickly and comprehensibly build a network of devices. Visit [wiki](https://github.com/gioblu/PJON/wiki) and [documentation](documentation/README.md) to know more about the PJON Standard.

PJON is used in thousands of devices and its community has spread worldwide because of the following 6 key factors:
- **New technology**: The [PJON](specification/PJON-protocol-specification-v3.0.md) network protocol stack is a new technology crafted in 7 years of research and experimentation. It was originally developed as an open-source alternative to i2c and 1-Wire but during development its scope and features have been extended to cover use cases where TCP-IP is generally applied although requiring slightly more than half of its overhead. PJON has been engineered to support feature modularity adding a variable footprint (3.5-8.2 kB program memory) and overhead (5-22 bytes per packet) depending on the features used.
- **Multi-media support**: PJON packets can be transmitted on a wide range of media and protocols like TCP, UDP, Serial, RS485 and LoRa. The PJON network protocol stack specifies and implements also the [PJDL](src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang/specification/PJDL-specification-v2.0.md) wired data link able to communicate data through a single common conductive element shared by up to 255 devices, [PJDLR](src/strategies/OverSampling/specification/PJDLR-specification-v2.0.md) wireless data link compatible with many ASK/FSK/OOK radio modules, and also [PJDLS](src/strategies/AnalogSampling/specification/PJDLS-specification-v1.0.md) wireless data link able to communicate through light pulses using off the shelf LEDs and laser diodes easing integration and enabling a lot of applications.
- **Increased security**: Devices using Ethernet/WiFi are often vulnerable to ransomware, illegal cyber warfare and private data leak. PJON has been engineered to enhance security not necessarily implementing the standard network protocol stack together with its vulnerabilities where it is not absolutely necessary offering a set of alternatives for many use cases.
- **Increased reliability**: Many protocols massively applied worldwide like 1-Wire, i2c and CAN expose dangerous vulnerabilities, their error detection algorithms are weak and they are not resilient to interference. The PJON network protocol stack is based on years of analysis and study not to make the same repeated mistakes present in most alternatives and provide with a simpler and more efficient solution.
- **High flexibility**: PJON is totally "software emulated" or executed by software without the use of dedicated hardware, for this reason its implementation can run a wide range of architectures; this engineering choice and its simplicity makes it easy to be ported on any computer or microcontroller. Its implementation is designed to enable developers to port new architectures in minutes defining a short set of interfaces to system calls.
- **Low cost**: Without any additional hardware needed to operate, minimal network wiring requirements and direct pin-to-pin or LED-to-LED communication, PJON is extremely energy efficient, cheap to be implemented and maintained. This implementation is kept updated and meticulously tested thanks to the strong commitment of its growing community of end users, testers and developers.

#### Safety warning
In all cases, when installing or maintaining a PJON network, extreme care must be taken to avoid any danger. When a [SoftwareBitBang](/src/strategies/SoftwareBitBang) bus is installed each pin must be protected with a current limiting resistor. When working with an [AnalogSampling](/src/strategies/AnalogSampling) LED or laser based setup safety glasses must be worn and transceivers must be operated cautiously to avoid potential eye injuries. Before any practical test or a hardware purchase for a wireless [OverSampling](/src/strategies/OverSampling), [ThroughSerial](/src/strategies/ThroughSerial) or [ThroughLoRa](/src/strategies/ThroughLoRa) radio setup, compliance with government requirements and regulations must be ensured. When connecting a local bus to the internet using [EthernetTCP](/src/strategies/EthernetTCP) or [GlobalUDP](/src/strategies/GlobalUDP) all connected devices must be considered potentially compromised, potentially manipulated or remotely actuated against your will. It should be considered a good practice not to connect to the internet systems that may create a damage (fire, flood, data-leak) if hacked.
