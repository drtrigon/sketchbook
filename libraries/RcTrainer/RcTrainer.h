/// \mainpage RcTrainer library for Arduino
///
/// This is the Arduino RcTrainer library.
/// It provides the ability to read the PPM encoded signal from an RC transmitter in trainer mode
/// containing the PPM encoded position of the servo channels.
///
/// Many RC transmitters provide a trainer output that is designed to allow 2 tranmsitters
/// to be connected for training purposes. The transmitter has a socket for a training cable.
/// When configured for training, the tranmitter emits a signal on that socket that encodes the position
/// of all the transmitters control channels
///
/// This library allows you to connect that training output signal to an Arduino, and to read the
/// channel outputs to control the Arduino.
///
/// Example Arduino programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded
/// from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RcTrainer/RcTrainer-1.0.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RcTrainer
///
/// \par Transmitters
///
/// This library has been tested with the following transmitters:
///
/// -Spektrum DX6i. The DX6i has a 3.5mm mono phone socket on the back. The signal is 3.3V p-p, normally high.
/// When you plug into the 'TRAINER' socket on the back, the transmitter comes on and sends the PPM signal
/// on the TRAINER socket. No radio signal is transmitted. Tested with Arduino Uno.
///
/// \par Connecting to Arduino
///
/// The connection between the transmitter and the Arduino must be electrically compatible,
/// and the connection must be made to one of the interrupt capable pins on the Arduino.
///
/// Some transmitters emit a 3.3V signal. This is compatible with a 3.3V Arduino, and may be compatible with
/// a 5V Arduino.
///
/// Some tramsmitters emit a 5V signal. This is compatible with a 5V Arduino, and may be compatible with
/// a 3.3V Arduino, provided the input is 5V tolerant.
///
/// The transmitter must be connected to one of the interrupt capable pins. On Arduino Uno for example,
/// this means digital inputs D2 or D3 only. Other Arduinos may have the interrupts on other pins and
/// there may be more interrupts.
///
/// Example for Spektrum DX6i and Arduino Uno:
/// \code
///                 Arduino      Spektrum DX6i
///                 D2-----------TIP
///                 GND----------RING
/// \endcode
///
/// \par Installation
///
/// Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries
/// sub-folder of your sketchbook.
