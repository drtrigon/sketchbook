# MoaT

or "Master of all Things" is a project to control various interesting
little things using 1wire, via a common interface.

The master copy of this code is located at https://github.com/M-o-a-T/owslave --
please come and contribute! (Bug reports welcome.)

## Goals

1wire is a nice protocol for wire-based home automation. It's reasonably
fast, stock hardware like basic I/O or temperature sensors are dirt cheap,
and you can attach tiny AVR controllers (think Arduino) without any
additional hardware.

It also has drawbacks. There's only one master, so you need to poll.
The available I/O solutions are limited. Most slaves can't be parameterized
in any meaningful way, can't work autonomously if the bus is wedged, and
don't use CONDITIONAL SEARCH (required for any non-trivial network).

MoaT slaves are different. A common configuration file lists the features
for each device you program. The parameters are added to the flash code
(or, in the hopefully-not-too-far future, to the device's EEPROM) and can
be interrogated via 1wire. OWFS then exports exactly those featurs which
your device actually uses.

## Implementation

The core code implements the basic 1wire discovery methods, including
single-device mode and conditional discovery.
Basic Code for e.g. the DS2423 fits in 2k on an ATtiny.
Barely, but it fits. ;-)

Overdrive speed is not implemented, and probably never will be,
because the timing constraints are too tight.

You can enable a debug pin which is a great help if you have timing
problems; just add a 2-channel oscilloscope.

The 64-bit ID is optionally read from EEPROM. A tool to generate the
8-bit CRC is included.

The 1wire bus must be connected to the INT0 pin. See `features.h` or your
microcontroller's data sheet which hardware pin that is. For example, on an
ATmega168 it's PD2 (pin 4 if your ATmega lives in a 28-pin PDIP package).
Add a power supply (leeching parasite power from the bus is not a good
idea) and a capacitor, and your 1wire slave is ready to go (of course, you
do need to program it).

### History

Originally, this project consisted of an effort to convert convoluted code
from the net, history unknown but apparently licensed GPL2, to something
equally convoluted but more generic. And large. The work then languished
for a couple of years.

At the beginning of 2015, Matthias Urlichs used code from Tobias Mueller
<mail@tobynet.de> to shrink down and rewrite the whole thing.

The Makefile was trimmed, build and device configuration was moved to a
separate config file, and the project goal became a whole lot more
ambitious.

### 1wire slaves

It appears that Dallas Semiconductor doesn't like people who
implement 1wire slaves in software.

On the other hand, they do discontinue ICs like the DS2423 counter
for which no known substitute exists.

Therefore, code to emulate specific 1wire slave ICs will only be added to
this project's repository if the ICs are no longer available or "not
recommended for new design".

Of course, code that does things which doesn't have a silicon equivalent is
always welcome.

### OWFS

A nice and shiny 1wire client does not help if there's no server.
Therefore, if you add your own code, please also submit
appropriate changes to the owfs project so that other people 
can actually talk to your stuff.

The OWFS code for MoaT devices is located at
git@github.com:M-o-a-T/owfs.git .

NB: OWFS supports conditional search even if the "alarm" directory is
missing. You can still access it.

## HOWTO

For build instructions, see HOWTO.md

### Rationale

This project uses its own build system, based on a configuration file and
`make`.

The reason is simple enough: suppose you want to prepare or update 100
devices for installation in a new house.

You do *not* want to click your way through a GUI to do this.

The first time through, you want to issue one command and then plug each
device into the programmer. Wait, unplug, repeat.

After it's all installed, you want to run "make update-all" and have the
build system handle everything. Yes, this includes firmware uploads via
1wire.

MoaT doesn't yet support online firmware updates. But it will.

## TODO

### bugs

* make sure that an idle 1wire never results in a hung device

### optimizations

* interrupt-based port monitoring
* hardware-based PWM

### implementations

* secondary 1wire bus?
* IÂ²C bus?
* RF12/RF69?
* more over-the-wire config changes
* over-the-wire firmware update
* some (esp. 1wire) statistics
* PID
* SMOKE
* I2C interface
* THERMO via I2C
* HYGRO via I2C
* serial bridge
* named ports
